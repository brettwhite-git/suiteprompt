Use when building reports, data exports, or analyzing NetSuite records.\n---\n\n# NetSuite SuiteQL Helper\n\n## Quick Reference\n\nSuiteQL is NetSuite's SQL-like query language for accessing record data. Use SuiteQL when you need:\n- Complex data joins across multiple record types\n- Aggregations and calculations\n- Performance-optimized queries\n- Direct database access\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Customer Queries\n```sql\nSELECT customer.id, customer.entityid, customer.companyname, customer.balance\nFROM customer\nWHERE customer.balance > 10000\nORDER BY customer.balance DESC\n```\n\n### Transaction Queries\n```sql\nSELECT transaction.id, transaction.tranid, transaction.trandate, transaction.total\nFROM transaction\nWHERE transaction.type = 'SalesOrd'\n  AND transaction.trandate >= '2024-01-01'\n```\n\n### Item/Inventory Queries\n```sql\nSELECT item.id, item.itemid, item.displayname, itemlocation.quantityonhand\nFROM item\nINNER JOIN itemlocation ON item.id = itemlocation.item\nWHERE itemlocation.location = 1\n  AND itemlocation.quantityonhand < item.reorderpoint\n```\n\n## MCP Integration\n\nWhen using with NetSuite MCP tools, use `NetSuite:runCustomSuiteQL` to execute queries:\n\n```\nRun this SuiteQL query: SELECT * FROM customer WHERE balance > 10000\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Always use read-only queries (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)\n- Include WHERE clauses to limit results\n- Use proper JOINs instead of subqueries when possible\n- Test queries in SuiteQL Query Tool first\n- Be mindful of governance limits\n- Use field IDs, not internal IDs in WHERE clauses\n\n## Common Fields\n\n- Customer: id, entityid, companyname, balance, email\n- Transaction: id, tranid, trandate, type, total, status\n- Item: id, itemid, displayname, baseprice\n- ItemLocation: item, location, quantityonhand, reorderpoint"

Use when encountering script errors or governance issues.\n---\n\n# SuiteScript Debugger\n\n## Error Analysis\n\nWhen debugging SuiteScript errors:\n\n1. **Identify the error type**:\n   - Syntax errors (check script syntax)\n   - Runtime errors (check record access, field existence)\n   - Governance errors (check usage limits)\n   - Type errors (check data types)\n\n2. **Check the error message**:\n   - Look for specific line numbers\n   - Identify missing modules or functions\n   - Check for undefined variables\n\n3. **Review script context**:\n   - Script type (User Event, Scheduled, etc.)\n   - Execution context (before/after submit)\n   - Record type being processed\n\n## Common Issues\n\n### Governance Limits\n\n```javascript\n// Check governance usage\nvar usage = runtime.getCurrentScript().getRemainingUsage();\nlog.debug('Remaining usage', usage);\n\n// Optimize searches\nvar search = search.create({...});\nsearch.run().each(function(result) {\n  // Process each result\n  return true; // Continue\n});\n```\n\n### Record Locking\n\n```javascript\n// Use try-catch for record locking\nvar record = record.load({...});\ntry {\n  record.setValue('field', value);\n  record.save();\n} catch (e) {\n  if (e.name === 'RECORD_LOCKED') {\n    // Handle lock error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Search Optimization\n\n```javascript\n// Use search columns efficiently\nvar search = search.create({\n  type: 'customer',\n  filters: [\n    ['balance', 'greaterthan', 1000]\n  ],\n  columns: ['entityid', 'companyname', 'balance'] // Only needed columns\n});\n```\n\n## Debugging Workflow\n\n1. Enable script logging\n2. Add log.debug() statements at key points\n3. Check execution log in NetSuite\n4. Use SuiteScript Debugger for step-through\n5. Test in sandbox first\n\n## Performance Tips\n\n- Minimize search result processing\n- Use batch processing for large datasets\n- Cache frequently accessed data\n- Avoid nested searches when possible\n- Use getValue/setValue efficiently"
