# Understanding NetSuite's Structure

## Introduction

Before diving into customization, it's crucial to understand how NetSuite is organized. Think of it as understanding the blueprint of a building before you start renovating.

    title: 'NetSuite Core Structure',
    category: 'fundamentals',
    simpleExplanation:
      'NetSuite is like a digital filing cabinet for your entire business. It has different drawers (modules) for different types of information - one for customers, one for inventory, one for financials, etc. Everything is connected so information flows automatically between these drawers.',
    technicalDetails:
      'NetSuite uses a record-based architecture:\n- Records: The fundamental data unit (customers, transactions, items)\n- Fields: Properties of records (name, email, amount)\n- Sublists: Lists within records (line items on an invoice)\n- Forms: The user interface for viewing/editing records\n- Scripts: Custom code that automates business logic',
    visualType: 'diagram',
    commonMistakes: [
      'Not understanding record relationships',
      'Confusing record types (e.g., Sales Order vs Invoice)',
      'Trying to access data without proper permissions',
    ],
    realWorldExample:
      'When you create a Sales Order in NetSuite, it automatically creates connections to the Customer record, Item records (for products), and can generate related records like Invoices and Fulfillments. It\'s all interconnected.',

## Key Concepts

### 1. Records and Fields

Every piece of data in NetSuite lives in a **record**. Each record has:
- **Internal ID**: A unique number that never changes
- **Fields**: Specific pieces of information (like "Company Name" or "Amount")
- **Relationships**: Connections to other records

### 2. Record Types

Common record types you'll work with:
- **Customers**: People or companies that buy from you
- **Items**: Products or services you sell
- **Transactions**: Sales Orders, Invoices, Purchase Orders
- **Employees**: People who work for your company

### 3. Forms and Layouts

Forms are what you see when viewing or editing a record. They're like templates that determine:
- Which fields are shown
- How fields are arranged
- What information is required vs optional

## Practice Exercise

💡 **Try This**: Navigate to a Customer record in your NetSuite account. Can you identify:
1. The Internal ID?
2. At least 5 different fields?
3. Any sublists (like addresses or contacts)?

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the structure, you're ready to create your first customization!
