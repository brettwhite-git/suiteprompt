# Your First Customization

## Introduction

Ready to make NetSuite work YOUR way? Let's start with something simple but powerful - adding a custom field.

    simpleExplanation:
      'Custom fields are like adding a new column to a spreadsheet. NetSuite comes with many built-in fields, but you can add your own to track information specific to your business. For example, if you sell clothing, you might add a "Season" field to track which season each item is for.',
    technicalDetails:
      'Custom fields in NetSuite:\n- Field Types: Text, Number, Date, Checkbox, List/Record, etc.\n- Can be added to almost any record type\n- Support validation rules\n- Can trigger workflows and scripts\n- Searchable and reportable',
    visualType: 'example',
    commonMistakes: [
      'Creating too many custom fields without a plan',
      'Not setting proper field labels',
      'Forgetting to set field permissions',
    ],
    realWorldExample:
      'A real estate company might add a "Property Type" field to their Item records to categorize properties as Residential, Commercial, or Industrial. This makes searching and reporting much easier.',
  }}

## Step-by-Step: Creating a Custom Field

### Step 1: Navigate to Custom Fields

1. Go to **Customization > Lists, Records, & Fields > Entity Fields**
2. Click **New**

### Step 2: Configure Your Field

Let's create a "Customer Priority" field:

- **Label**: Customer Priority
- **Type**: List/Record
- **List/Record**: Create a new list with values:
  - High Priority
  - Medium Priority
  - Standard
- **Help Text**: Indicates the service level for this customer
- **Default Value**: Standard

### Step 3: Set Display Settings

- **Display Type**: Normal
- **Applies To**: Customer
- **Subtab**: Classification (or create a custom subtab)

### Step 4: Set Access Permissions

- **Store Value**: Checked
- **Available Externally**: Checked if needed for APIs
- **Role Restrictions**: Set which roles can see/edit this field

### Step 5: Save and Test

1. Click **Save**
2. Navigate to any Customer record
3. Look for your new field!

## Best Practices

### 📋 Field Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive labels
- Avoid abbreviations unless industry-standard
- Consider how it will appear in reports

### 🔒 Security Considerations

- Only give edit access to roles that need it
- Use field-level security for sensitive data
- Consider workflow approvals for critical fields

### 📊 Impact on Reporting

Custom fields can be:
- Added to saved searches
- Used in reports and dashboards
- Referenced in formulas

## Advanced: Custom Record Types

Once you're comfortable with custom fields, you can create entirely new **Custom Record Types**. These are like creating brand new tables in your database.

Example use cases:
- Project Management: Custom "Project" records
- Real Estate: Custom "Property" records
- Education: Custom "Course" records

## Practice Challenge

🎯 **Your Turn**: Create a custom field called "Preferred Contact Method" on the Customer record with these values:
- Email
- Phone
- Text Message
- In Person

Make it a required field and add it to the Communication subtab.

## Next Steps

Great work! Now you know how to extend NetSuite's data model. Next, we'll learn how to deploy and manage your customizations.
