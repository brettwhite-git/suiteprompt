# Advanced CI/CD Integration

## Introduction

Take your deployment automation to the next level with advanced CI/CD techniques including parallel testing, deployment strategies, and enterprise-grade pipelines.

## Advanced GitHub Actions

### Matrix Testing

Test across multiple NetSuite versions and configurations:

<CodePlayground
  initialCode={`# .github/workflows/advanced-test.yml
name: Advanced Testing

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
        ns-version: ['2023.1', '2023.2', '2024.1']
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js \${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: \${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
        env:
          NS_VERSION: \${{ matrix.ns-version }}`}
  language="yaml"

## Blue-Green Deployments

Deploy new version alongside old, then switch traffic:

1. Deploy to "green" environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Switch router to green
4. Keep blue as fallback

## Canary Deployments

Gradually roll out to subset of users:

1. Deploy to 5% of users
2. Monitor metrics
3. Increase to 25%, 50%, 100%
4. Rollback if issues detected

## Practice

🎯 Build a complete CI/CD pipeline with testing, staging, and production deployments
