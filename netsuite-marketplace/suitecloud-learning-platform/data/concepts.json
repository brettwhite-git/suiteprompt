      "simpleExplanation": "Deploying code to NetSuite is like moving furniture into a new house. You pack your code (bundle), transport it (deploy), and unpack it in the right rooms (NetSuite account).",
      "technicalDetails": "The deployment process involves: 1) Building your project, 2) Bundling files according to deploy.xml, 3) Validating against NetSuite, 4) Uploading files and creating objects, 5) Installing SuiteApp if applicable.",

        "Deploying to production without testing",
        "Not checking dependencies"
      ],
      "realWorldExample": "Like deploying a website: you write code locally, build it, then push it to a server where users can access it."

      "category": "spa",
      "simpleExplanation": "A Single Page Application (SPA) is like a smart TV remote. The remote (client) talks to the TV (server) to get what you need, but you don't need to change the channel by going to a new page.",
      "technicalDetails": "SPAs use client-side routing, state management, and server-side APIs. The client handles UI rendering while the server provides data and business logic.",

      "commonMistakes": [
        "Mixing client and server logic",
        "Not handling loading states",
        "Forgetting error handling"
      ],
      "realWorldExample": "Like Gmail - the page doesn't reload when you open an email, it just updates the content dynamically."

      "title": "SDF Project Structure",
      "category": "sdf",
      "simpleExplanation": "An SDF project is like a well-organized filing cabinet. Each drawer (folder) has a specific purpose: scripts go here, objects go there, files go in another place.",
      "technicalDetails": "SDF projects follow a specific structure: src/FileCabinet for files, src/Objects for custom objects, src/AccountConfiguration for settings, and manifest.xml for project metadata.",
      "visualType": "tree-diagram",
      "commonMistakes": [
        "Putting files in wrong folders",
        "Not following naming conventions",
        "Missing manifest.xml"
      ],
      "realWorldExample": "Like a restaurant kitchen - ingredients (files) have specific places, recipes (scripts) are organized, and the menu (manifest) describes what's available."
